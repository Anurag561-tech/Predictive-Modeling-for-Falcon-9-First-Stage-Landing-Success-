# Predictive Modeling for Falcon-9 First Stage Landing Success
 
This project aims to predict whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land after a rocket launch. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at a significantly lower cost than its competitors, largely due to the reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. By accurately predicting landing success, we can estimate launch costs and provide valuable insights for companies bidding against SpaceX.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Predictive Modeling for Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success
- **Goal:** Predict the likelihood of a Falcon 9 first stage successfully landing after launch.
- **Significance:** SpaceX charges $62 million per launch compared to competitors who charge upwards of $165 million. The cost savings stem from the reusability of the first stage. By predicting landing success, we can help estimate costs and enhance business strategies.

### 2. Data Collection and Wrangling
- **Data Manipulation:** Write Python code to manipulate data within a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Conversion:** Convert JSON files into Pandas DataFrames.
- **Data Sharing:** Create and share a Jupyter notebook on GitHub for collaborative purposes.
- **Business Problem Formulation:** Define and formulate real-world business problems using data science methodologies.
- **Data Preparation:** Load, clean, and analyze datasets to extract meaningful insights.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Gathering:** Utilize RESTful APIs and web scraping techniques to gather relevant data.
- **Data Visualization:** Create scatter plots and bar charts using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
- **SQL Queries:** Perform exploratory data analysis by manipulating data and executing SQL queries to identify patterns.
- **Pattern Identification:** Visualize data to guide the machine learning modeling process.

### 4. Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
- **Dashboard Development:** Build interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash for analyzing SpaceX launch records.
- **Interactive Maps:** Develop interactive maps with the Folium library to examine launch site proximity and other geographical insights.
- **Feature Implementation:** Incorporate features like pie charts, scatter plots, and distance calculations on interactive maps to enhance data analysis.

### 5. Predictive Analysis (Classification)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Use machine learning techniques to predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success.
- **Data Splitting:** Split data into training and test sets, and perform hyperparameter tuning for models such as SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of models and select the best-performing model based on test data, aimed at improving business efficiency.
