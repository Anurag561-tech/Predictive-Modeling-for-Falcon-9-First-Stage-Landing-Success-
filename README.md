# Predictive Modeling for Falcon-9 First Stage Landing Success
### _Predict if SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully after rocket launch._

In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly cheaper than competitors who charge upwards of $165 million per launch. Much of this cost saving is due to the reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. By predicting successful landings, we can estimate launch costs and provide valuable insights for companies bidding against SpaceX.

## Data Collection and Wrangling
### _Objectives_
- Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Convert a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create and share a Jupyter notebook on GitHub.
- Define and formulate real-world business problems using data science methodologies.
- Load, clean, and analyze a dataset to extract meaningful insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### _Objectives_
- Utilize RESTful APIs and web scraping to gather data and convert it into a DataFrame.
- Create scatter plots and bar charts using Python and Pandas.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data and executing SQL queries.
- Visualize data to identify patterns and guide the modeling process.

## Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
### _Objectives_
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash to analyze launch records.
- Develop interactive maps with the Folium library to analyze launch site proximity.
- Implement features such as pie charts, scatter plots, and distance calculations on interactive maps.

## Predictive Analysis (Classification)
### _Objectives_
- Use machine learning to predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success.
- Split data into training and test sets, and perform hyperparameter tuning for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluate and select the best-performing model based on test data to improve business efficiency.
