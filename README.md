# Predictive Modeling for Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success ðŸš€

This project focuses on predicting the landing success of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage using historical data and various machine learning models. The analysis spans from data collection to visualization, interactive dashboard creation, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized space travel by successfully reusing Falcon 9 first-stage boosters. This project aims to replicate their approach by predicting the landing success of the Falcon 9 first stage. The repository includes data collection via APIs and web scraping, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), interactive mapping, and the development of machine learning models for predictive analytics.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - SpaceX Launch Data via REST APIs.
   - Historical Falcon 9 launch records via web scraping from Wikipedia.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Data wrangling, visualization with Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
   - SQL-based data exploration.
   - Interactive data visualization using Folium and Plotly Dash.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Classification models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors).
   - Model tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

- **Plotly Dash Dashboard**: Filter launches by site and payload mass, visualizing success rates with pie charts and scatter plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Dash
- Folium, BeautifulSoup, Requests
- SQLite for SQL analysis

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques in predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. By utilizing historical launch data and applying various machine learning models, we have gained valuable insights into factors influencing launch outcomes. These insights reveal how data-driven strategies can optimize launch operations and improve decision-making processes.

By understanding which factors contribute most to landing success, this project serves as a foundation for more efficient rocket launches and cost-saving measures in the aerospace industry. It also highlights the potential for further development in predictive modeling to enhance performance and increase reliability in future space missions.
